## Codebase
This project is built using React as the front end library with no backend, and Redux for application state management. To simulate async requests, requests is served using mock api server.
### Technologies
* [React](https://reactjs.org/): React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/): jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): Webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/): Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* [Toastr](): A Javascript library for non-blocking notifications.
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): Jest is a omplete and ready to set-up JavaScript testing solution.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/): Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
* [React-Router-Dom](): DOM bindings for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/): a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
